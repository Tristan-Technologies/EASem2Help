# MQ135

MQ135 is the gas sensor that we used for our prototype.

### How it works:
the gas sensitive material used in the MQ135 gas sensor is tin dioxide (SnO2) with low conductivity in clean air. When there is polluted gas in the environment, the conductivity of the sensor increases with the concentration of polluted gas in the air. The MQ135 gas sensor is highly sensitive to ammonia, sulfide, benzene vapor, and ideal for monitoring smog and other hazardous gases. This sensor can detect a variety of harmful gases, is a low-cost sensor suitable for a variety of applications.
Here is the circuit in MQ135:
