#My Reflection

It was both fun and stressful doing this project.

As a electrical student, I didn't know a lot about mechanical calculations and 3D modelling. However, as my group progressed further, I realised that it was important that should consider what kind of motor is required for project. I also found it easier to design a mount by using a 3D model rather than drawing out a design based on estimated measurements. Through this project, I have a deeper appreciation for the mechanical aspects when doing a project.

One thing this project has taught me to manage my time better. During the semester, I had other projects - both group and individual - which were due around the same time. I had to switch my focus between these projects as well as my studies which made me feel very stressed. Sometimes, I had to go to sleep late at night to finish a task. However, despite this challenge, I learnt to persevere and not give up until the job is done. In the end, I managed to finish everything and can now fully focus on my studies.
