As a EEE student, I did most of the wire connection and soldering in our group.Besides, I learnt how to use fusion360 for the machanical part.
Before this project, I have no experience using fusion360. 
In this project, my job is to do the electrical connection, circuit design, and tank outlook design. We met a problem for the circuit design
when there is only two 3.7v battery to power up the whole circuit as I'm afraid the current might not enough for the motor. To solve that problem,
we series the battery to get the highest voltage that we can get to minimize the power lost and use shield for esp32 so that we no need to separate 
another voltage line form the power source.
Another challenge we met is the tank outlook design. As a EEE student, I have no experience for this area. Though this project, I learn how to use 
fusion 360 to build the model and learn how to create a good design to place all the components inside. When I did design, I didn't consider
some of the components that need to put outside so I did not leave the space for them at the first time. When we need to assemble the tank, I found
my design forgot a lot of things. Then I have to spend time to redesign and reprint it. 
Though this project, I leant that need to think form the big picture not just focus on the things that in front of you only. This will not only 
helpful for my school project but also in my future work.
