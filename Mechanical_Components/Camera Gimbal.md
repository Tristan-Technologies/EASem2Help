# Camera Gimbal

In order for us survey the interior of the mine, we designed a dual axis camera Gimbal for rotation along the x-y axis.

The design consists of a bottom servo holder, upper servo holder and camera holder.

The bottom servo holder is used to mount the gimbal to the vehicle securely. The upper servo holder acts as a connector to the first servo and allows the camera to move along the x-axis. The camera holder acts as connector to the second servo and allows the camera to move along the y-axis.

Both servo and camera holders are tight fitting to reduce the need of additional fasteners and provides a simple and easy assembly process.

In addition, the design of the gimbal allows for near unlimited rotation in both axes. Limitation comes from the servo model being used.
