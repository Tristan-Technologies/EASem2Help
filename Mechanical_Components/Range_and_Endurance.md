# Range and Endurance


After building our model tank, we conducted a few test runs to find out well our vehicle can operate.


**Endurance of Vehicle**

Based on the test runs, we discovered that the UGV can operate at a maximum velocity of about **0.9 m/s** with the maximum distance it can travel before losing connection with the controller module being **20 meters**( the size of 2 classrooms).

Another factor we discovered during testing was the endurance of our motors. When the batteries are fully- charged, motors are able to operate smoothly. However, as we continue to test, the motor speed gradually started to drop due to the batteries running out of power. Trough this test, we realized that the UGV could operate for about **40 minutes** before the batteries die.
