# Fusion360 Model

We created a 3D model of the tank chassis in Fusion360 to help us create a design to mount our electrical and mechanical components to  our UGV. We gathered measurements from the actual tank chassis and used in in our 3D model. This way, the design of the mounting will be an accurate fit to the real tank chassis.

## Features

**Base Mount**

![base mount]()

The base mount was designed to acts as an interface between the individual components and the tank chassis.

The base has fitting components such as holes for components to be bolted down using screws and nuts as well as square compartments for walls to be connected using 'lock and key' joints.

**Walls**

Similar to the base, the walls are designed to lock onto the base securely to reduce the number of fasteners. Some walls have holes to allow components to be secured using screws and nuts while others have small openings to allow wires to go through easily.

**Cover**

Similar to the walls and base, the cover is designed to lock with the walls and enclose the inner components to protect them from outside interference. It has holes and square openings to accommodate for screws and nuts. The camera gimbal will be secured on top of the cover.
