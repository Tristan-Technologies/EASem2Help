# Fusion360 Model

We created a 3D model of the tank chassis in Fusion360 to help us visualize mounting our electrical and mechanical components to our UGV chassis. We gathered measurements from the actual tank chassis and used in in our 3D model. This way, the design of the mounting will be an accurate fit to the real tank chassis. As much as possible, online CAD models of existing components (such as motor drivers) were used as these would reduce the need for a lengthy measurement as well as a trial and error process. 

These CAD models would then be used as the basis for designing the relevant mounting feautures on the box.

## Features

**Base Mount**

![base mount]()

The base mount was designed to act as an interface between the individual components and the tank chassis.

The base has fitting components such as holes for components to be bolted down using bolts and nuts as well as holes for body panels to be connected using 'lock and key' joints.

**Walls**

The body panels are designed to be friction fit onto the base securely to reduce the number of fasteners. This is acheived by means of a lock and key design. The protrusions on the wall panel are the 'key' and the complementary holes on the base cover are the lock. Some panels have holes to allow components to be secured using screws and nuts while others have small openings to allow wires to go through easily.

**Cover**

The cover is designed to lock with the panels and enclose the electrical components to protect them from outside interference. It has holes and square openings to accommodate for screws and nuts. The camera gimbal is secured on top of the cover.
