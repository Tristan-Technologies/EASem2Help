# Fusion360 Model

We created a 3D model of the tank chassis in Fusion360 to help us visualize mounting our electrical and mechanical components to our UGV chassis. We gathered measurements from the actual tank chassis and used in in our 3D model. This way, the design of the mounting will be an accurate fit to the real tank chassis.

## Features

**Base Mount**

![base mount]()

The base mount was designed to act as an interface between the individual components and the tank chassis.

The base has fitting components such as holes for components to be bolted down using bolts and nuts as well as holes for body panels to be connected using 'lock and key' joints.

**Walls**

The body panels are designed to lock onto the base securely to reduce the number of fasteners. Some panels have holes to allow components to be secured using screws and nuts while others have small openings to allow wires to go through easily.

**Cover**

The cover is designed to lock with the panels and enclose the electrical components to protect them from outside interference. It has holes and square openings to accommodate for screws and nuts. The camera gimbal is secured on top of the cover.
