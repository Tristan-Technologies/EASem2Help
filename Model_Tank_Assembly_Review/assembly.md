## Model tank Assembly Process

As the central theme of our project revolves around a treaded vehicle, we were given a Common Carrier Platform that was purchased off Aliexpress. It was a simple, tank chassis frame constructed out of steel and aluminum which was very sturdy and precisely machined.

While the tank chassis did not come with any instruction manual itself, there was an [online guide](https://github.com/SmartArduino/SZDOITWiKi/wiki/Robot-car-Preface) uploaded to Github for us to follow along. The guide on Github provided a step by step breakdown on how to assemble the components. As the first order of business, the team decided that it was prudent to take inventory of all the components provided in the kit. This allowed us an overview of what components we had and how many were available to us during the assembly process. It would also facilitate finding spare parts should the need arise. Our breakdown was as follows:

## Installation steps:
### 1.0: Install load bearing wheel

1.1: **Install the load bearing wheel at the round hole circled in yellow**

1.2: **Use M3*8 inner hexagon screws on both sides to lock the bearing wheel copper column**

1.3: **Fixed bearing wheel copper column on both sides**

1.4:**Center round holes on both sides of the bearing wheel are put into the bearing**

1.5: **Lock the connector with M2 screw after passing through the bearings on both sides**

1.6: **Place the gasket on top of the connector and the short M4 hexagon socket screw passes through the other side of the bracket**

1.7: **M4 screw lock the connector and secure the load bearing wheel**

### 2.0: Installing the drive wheel

![hihi](https://github.com/Tristan-Technologies/EASem2Help/blob/master/Model_Tank_Assembly_Review/Images/2.1.png)

2.1: **First, go through the M3*8 inner hexagon screw on each drive wheel to lock the copper column of the drive wheel**

2.2 **Lock the copper column with M3 inner hexagon screws on both sides**

![hihi](https://github.com/Tristan-Technologies/EASem2Help/blob/master/Model_Tank_Assembly_Review/Images/2.3.png)

2.3: **Use a small wrench to temporarily secure the top wire to the small round hole of the coupling**

### 3.0: Install the drive wheel on the motor
