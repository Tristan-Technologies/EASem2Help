## Model tank Assembly Process

As the central theme of our project revolves around a treaded vehicle, we were given a Common Carrier Platform that was purchased off Aliexpress. It was a simple, tank chassis frame constructed out of steel and aluminum which was very sturdy and precisely machined.

While the tank chassis did not come with any instruction manual itself, there was an [online guide](https://github.com/SmartArduino/SZDOITWiKi/wiki/Robot-car-Preface) uploaded to Github for us to follow along. The guide on Github provided a step by step breakdown on how to assemble the components. As the first order of business, the team decided that it was prudent to take inventory of all the components provided in the kit. This allowed us an overview of what components we had and how many were available to us during the assembly process. It would also facilitate finding spare parts should the need arise. Our breakdown was as follows:


*(Camillia add in the breakdown and the picture of all the parts together pls big thank -tristan)*


Following the manual, the first components to be assembled was the sprocket assembly. These consisted of fitting 3 copper standoffs onto a an aluminum sprocket plate, before securing those with 2 M3 x *(help I forgot what)* screws.

 Following this step, the motor connector is slid into the 2 concentric holes, which are fitted with flanged bearings. The assembly is capped of with a single M3 x *(help I forgot again)* screws. This part was slightly trickier since the connector had a tendency to slip as the screw was tightened. In response to this, we just gripped the rod with our shirts or other fabric when tightening the screws. After this stage, the sprocket assembly should be able to freely rotate around the axis of the connector shaft with little friction. Subsequently, 2 grub screws were added to the 2 holes on the connector shaft to grip onto the motor.
