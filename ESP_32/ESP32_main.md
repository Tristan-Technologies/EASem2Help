### Working with the ESP 32

The ESP 32 is a multifunctional controller unit that can operate uing many different types of firmware, granting it unique versatility to be used in a wide range of projects.

For the purposes of this project, Micropython will be used to control the system. The specific implementation of the ESP32 utillised in this project is the ESP32-WROOM-32D, manufactured by Espressif. It is equipped with Wifi as well as ULE Bluetooth, and comes with a host of IO pins for interfacing with sensors and other peripherals. This gives it a unique ability to interface with cloud computing systems (eg. Thingspeak). Other features include and Analog Digital Converter (ADC).

This page serves as the documentation for all ESP32 related operations and provides  the resources necessary to implement this project successfully.
