## Working with the ESP 32

The ESP 32 is a multifunctional controller unit that can operate using many different types of firmware, granting it unique versatility to be used in a wide range of projects.

For the purposes of this project, MicroPython will be used to control the system. The specific implementations of the ESP32 utilised in this project is the ESP32-WROOM-32D and the ESP32 CAM. Both are equipped with Wifi as well as ULE Bluetooth, and comes with a host of IO pins for interfacing with sensors and other peripherals. This gives it a unique ability to interface with cloud platforms (eg. Thingspeak, AWS IoT), and in the case of the ESP32 CAM, photography and videography capability.

This page serves to provide the documentation required to set up the ESP32 microcontrollers used in the project correctly.
