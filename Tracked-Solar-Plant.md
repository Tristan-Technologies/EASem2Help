# Project Abstract





In response to a need for easily available energy sources in humanitarian crisis situations, the feasibility of a mobile solar energy generator, mounted on a mobile, ruggedized platform is investigated. The proposed system is designed for both immediate relief in the period right after the disaster as well as extended use, as a quasi permanent energy production installation. It may also be used to complement existing energy generation sources like Diesel Generators, to form a hybrid energy solution.



# Introduction

In the context of disaster relief, Solar energy is a logical choice to turn to in order to meet the energy demands of humanitarian relief efforts. As opposed to Internal Combustion Engine Generators (examples of which are diesel and petrol), which require a steady supply of fuel, solar energy requires no such consumables, dramatically simplifying the logistical support required to adopt it as an energy solution. This freed up logistical capacity can then be used for much more valuable purposes in the humanitarian relief effort.



A good example would be Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The automaker Tesla offered its solar power systems to aid in the disaster relief effort, powering a Children's hospital which serves 3000. The logistical simplicity of Solar allows it to be deployed in a matter of hours, greatly increasing its efficacy and restoring power rapidly.



Having mentioned all of this, it has to be noted that Solar power does not form a core component of NGO disaster relief efforts, most of which would still rather stock up on traditional energy systems like diesel generators. Depending on the locality of where the solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels are deployed, energy output may also vary. These PV systems have proven to be sensitive to ambient weather conditions, with something as simple as a cloudy day reducing energy output.



Then there is the question of getting the PV panels to where they need to be, which depending on their generation capacity, may be fairly formidable in size. If PV panels were to be deployed to Nepal after an earthquake, for an instance, they would need some method of traversing the mountainous terrain which is characteristic of the Nepalese environment.
